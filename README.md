# Soviet-Cargo

Soviet Cargo is a Tower-Defense-Game set in the UDSSR in the future.

The year is 2055. The UDSSR is strong again but started to focus on itself to stay that way without the west that tries to conquest the whole world.
The border of the UDSSR is in danger! Republicans try to break into your Base and you got to do something against it. You are the planner of the defense-towers that help protect our border. Build Towers and traps to defend us and you will be becoming our Hero!
